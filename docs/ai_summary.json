{"model":"gpt-5-mini","status":"success","viewed":false,"summary":"- Schedule change: class schedule start moved from XXXXXX06 to XXXXXX23 (Original Start Date updated), end date changed (XXXXXXXXXXXX18 → XXXXXX01). Recurring pattern: weekly on Wednesday and Friday, 08:00–10:00 (2h each). Follow-up: confirm learners and venue/calendar updated to the new start and end dates.\n- Learners: Learner A (CL4), Learner B (NL4), Learner C (level not set) — all marked CIC (currently in class). Follow-up: verify Learner C’s qualification/placement and confirm all three were notified of the new start.\n- Staffing gap: Class Agent is null; Initial Class Agent = \"2\" (appears as an unresolved ID); Backup Agent list is empty. Follow-up: assign/confirm a named class agent and at least one backup before the new start.\n- Data inconsistencies / risks: new_row \"Start Date\" remains XXXXXX06 while Schedule Startdate is XXXXXX23 — clarify which is the operative start to avoid clashes. Also total Duration = 240 hours vs scheduled 4 hours/week (Wed+Fri) — confirm intended delivery hours or additional sessions.\n- Operational exceptions: three exception dates listed and holiday override set for 2025-12-26; there is a Stop/Restart entry (Stop XXXXXX12 → Restart XXXXXX05). Follow-up: review these exceptions against attendance, delivery continuity and any funding/attendance reporting.","attempts":1,"viewed_at":null,"error_code":null,"tokens_used":2516,"generated_at":"2025-10-28T03:46:04+00:00","error_message":null,"processing_time_ms":17310}
