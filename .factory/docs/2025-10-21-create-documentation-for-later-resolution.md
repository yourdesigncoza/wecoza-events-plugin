Issue: Remove "create-class" task template from frontend but commenting out in TaskTemplateRegistry doesn't work

**Current Status**:
- User manually cleared database entries (Option 2)
- "create-class" line is commented out in TaskTemplateRegistry
- Task still appears in frontend

**Root Cause Analysis Complete**:
- TaskTemplateRegistry provides templates for operations ('insert', 'update', 'delete')
- Tasks are cached in database via TaskManager::getTasksWithTemplate()
- Frontend loads via ClassTaskService → TaskManager → TaskTemplateRegistry flow

**Possible Remaining Issues**:
1. WordPress/object cache not cleared
2. Incomplete database cleanup  
3. Server-side caching interference

**Documentation Plan**:
1. Create issue documentation file in docs folder
2. Document current investigation findings
3. List troubleshooting steps for later resolution
4. Include verification checklist
